        <h1><b>"Balicaocao Eco Park"</b></h1>
            <h2> Is nestled on a hill with an epic panoramic view of Kabankalan City and nearby towns. Located in Barangay Orong, Balicaocao is just a short 25-minute bumpy ride from the highway. There are some motorcycles for hire when you get to the junction along the highway.
            It is a perfect place for a picnic with family and friends. The entrance fee is just around Php 20 per person. For day trips, you can rent one of the open cottages or simply put up a tent on the grounds. There are also benches where you can just sit, relax, and enjoy the view. They have a small sari-sari store where you can buy drinks and snacks. You can also bring your own food and use the cooking/grilling area for your meals.</h2>
